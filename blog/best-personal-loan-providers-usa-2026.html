                    <p>Backed by Goldman Sachs, Marcus offers transparent pricing with no hidden fees. Rates start at 6.99% APR for loans between $3,500 and $40,000.

                    <h2>Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a Personal Loan</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Interest Rates and APR</h3>
                    <p>The annual percentage rate (APR) represents the true cost of borrowing, including interest and fees. Compare APRs rather than just interest rates, as some lenders may have lower rates but higher fees that make the total cost more expensive.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Loan Terms and Flexibility</h3>
                    <p>Consider both the loan amount you need and the repayment term that works best for your budget. Longer terms mean lower monthly payments but higher total interest costs. Shorter terms save money on interest but require higher monthly payments.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Fees and Charges</h3>
                    <p>Look for lenders with minimal fees. Common fees include origination fees (1-8% of loan amount), late payment fees, and prepayment penalties. The best lenders offer fee-free options or transparent fee structures.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Eligibility Requirements</h3>
                    <p>Most personal loan lenders require a minimum credit score of 600-640, stable income, and debt-to-income ratio below 40%. Some lenders specialize in borrowers with lower credit scores, while others cater to prime borrowers with excellent credit.</p>

                    <h2>How to Improve Your Chances of Approval</h2>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Check and improve your credit score</strong> - Pay bills on time, reduce credit card balances, and dispute any errors on your credit report</li>
                        <li><strong>Calculate your debt-to-income ratio</strong> - Keep it below 40% for better approval chances</li>
                        <li><strong>Gather required documentation</strong> - Pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements, and identification</li>
                        <li><strong>Shop around</strong> - Compare multiple lenders to find the best rates and terms</li>
                        <li><strong>Consider a cosigner</strong> - If you have poor credit, a cosigner with good credit can improve your approval chances</li>
                    </ul>
