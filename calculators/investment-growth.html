                        <h3>How the Investment Growth Calculator Works</h3>
                        <p>This calculator projects the growth of your investment using compound interest formulas. It accounts for both an initial investment and ongoing monthly contributions:</p>
                        <p>Future Value = Initial Investment × (1 + r)^n + Monthly Contribution × [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r] × (1 + r)</p>
                        <p>Where:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>r = Monthly rate of return (annual rate divided by 12 and 100)</li>
                            <li>n = Total number of months (years × 12)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Compound interest allows your investment to grow exponentially because you earn returns not only on your original principal but also on the accumulated returns from previous periods. This "snowball effect" becomes more pronounced over longer time horizons.</p>
