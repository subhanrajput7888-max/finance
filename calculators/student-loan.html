                        <h3>How the Student Loan Calculator Works</h3>
                        <p>The monthly student loan payment is calculated using the formula:</p>
                        <p>MP = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n-1]</p>
                        <p>Where:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>MP = Monthly payment</li>
                            <li>P = Loan principal (total amount borrowed)</li>
                            <li>r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12 and 100)</li>
                            <li>n = Total number of payments (repayment term in months)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Student loans typically have fixed interest rates and repayment periods of 10-25 years. Federal student loans often offer income-driven repayment plans that adjust payments based on your income and family size.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <div class="faq-question"><strong>What's the difference between federal and private student loans?</strong></div>
                            <div class="faq-answer">Federal loans typically offer lower fixed interest rates, income-driven repayment options, and loan forgiveness programs. Private loans are offered by banks and credit unions, often requiring a co-signer and having variable interest rates.</div>
                        </div>

                            <div class="faq-question"><strong>Can I pay off student loans early without penalties?</strong></div>
                            <div class="faq-answer">Yes, most student loans (both federal and private) allow prepayment without penalties. Making extra payments can save you thousands in interest over the life of the loan.</div>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <div class="faq-question"><strong>What are income-driven repayment plans?</strong></div>
                            <div class="faq-answer">These federal loan programs cap monthly payments at a percentage of discretionary income (usually 10-20%) and forgive remaining balances after 20-25 years of qualifying payments. Options include PAYE, REPAYE, IBR, and ICR plans.</div>
